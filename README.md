# Instructions of Python Application

Once you run the code in MAIN.py, the code will ask you for your MySQL credentials. You should be careful not to input wrong username or password. In case of a wrong input, it will ask you to input again.

After inputing correct credentials the code will create database and tables. In case if those steps are already done before, it will just skip them. Then, it will ask you if you want to load the data into the tables or not. By looking at your decision, it will either load it or skip this part as well.

Then the application will give you six data analysis queries and one exit option. In case if you input "0" it will stop running. 

To see the results that you want, just input the number of that command and the application will give you the output. After that, it will ask you again until you exit the application.

Here are the commands that you can give:
1. Yearly Trends: Top Song Per Year by Streams and Danceability
2. Top 5 High Valence Songs
3. Top 3 High Energy Years (>80%)
4. Top 10 Most Streamed Songs
5. Average Danceability by Release Year     
6. BPM Distribution on Each Decade
0. Exit. 

---

e.g.: To see the "Top 5 High Valence Songs", input "2". 

If you enter an invalid command, it will give an error message and ask you to give a new command.
